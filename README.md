> [!TIP]
> The approach of this implementation bypasses the performance limitations of the 2D canvas API, enabling smooth and dynamic visual effects directly on the GPU.

> [!NOTE]
> This library was inspired by these excellent tutorials:
> - [Three.js Journey - Particle Cursor Animation Shader](https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/particles-cursor-animation-shader).
> - [Learn Creative Coding: Image Effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeZ1pTg_nMo).
